# LogParser.py



This script takes a single command line argument, which is the path to the log file to parse. It reads the log file, parses it using the parse_log function, and then prints the resulting list of dictionaries. Feel Free to comment for any changes and use it to parse through any sample logs you may have. This is very elementary so constructive critisim would be appreciated.
